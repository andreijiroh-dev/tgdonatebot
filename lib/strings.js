Hello there!

I am an Telegram bot that handle donations for @ajhalili2006's \
open-source and writing work, as well as managing monthly and annual \
sponsorship (and its perks).

If you want me to use this bot for your own sponsorship program, \
you may need to fork the codebase that powers this bot under the \
terms of AGPL license.
